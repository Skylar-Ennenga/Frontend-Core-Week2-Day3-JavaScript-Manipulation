<!-- 1. Document Manipulation with JavaScript

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance proficiency in manipulating HTML documents dynamically using JavaScript, focusing on the manipulation of arrays and objects to modify document content and structure.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page that dynamically updates its content based on user interaction. The page should utilize JavaScript to manipulate the document structure and content using arrays and objects.

Task 1: Create an array containing information about different products, including their names, prices, and descriptions.

let products = [
    { name: "Laptop", price: 999.99, description: "Powerful computing on the go" },
    { name: "Smartphone", price: 699.99, description: "Stay connected wherever you are" },
    { name: "Headphones", price: 149.99, description: "Immersive audio experience" }
];

Task 2: Write a function to display the product information on the webpage dynamically.

Task 3: Implement an event listener to trigger the display of products when the page loads.

Expected Outcomes:

    Successful creation of an array containing product information.

    Proper display of product information on the webpage using JavaScript.

    Implementation of an event listener to trigger the display of products upon page load. -->
